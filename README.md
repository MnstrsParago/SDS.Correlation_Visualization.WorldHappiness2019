# World Happiness Report (2019)
Subject: SDS (Statistics and Data Science) / Correlation Analysis + Data Visualization (EDA)  
Name: Abdanur

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes the **World Happiness Report 2019** dataset.  
The main goal is to explore the data, calculate descriptive statistics, create multiple visualizations, and study relationships between variables using correlation (for example, how different factors relate to the happiness score).

Dataset file in this repository: `2019.csv`  
Original source (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness

## 💡 Features
- Load and clean the dataset (check missing values, data types, duplicates)
- Basic exploration: dataset shape, columns, and summary info
- Descriptive statistics for key numerical variables:
  - mean, median, mode
  - variance, standard deviation, range, IQR
- Visualizations (at least 5 types), such as:
  - histogram (distributions)
  - boxplot (outliers)
  - bar chart (categorical comparisons if needed)
  - scatterplots (relationships between variables)
  - extra plot (example: pairplot / heatmap)
- Relationship analysis:
  - correlation coefficients (Pearson/Spearman)
  - correlation matrix / heatmap
  - interpretation of strength and direction of relationships
- Probability/distribution checks (example: normality checks using plots)

## 📦 Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MnstrsParago/SDS.Correlation_Visualization.WorldHappiness2019.git
   cd SDS.Correlation_Visualization.WorldHappiness2019
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Open and run the notebook:
   - `abdanur_ayazbek_task2_analysis.ipynb`

## 📘 Reflection
This project helped me improve my skills in exploring real datasets, creating clear visualizations, and using correlation to understand relationships between variables.  
It also trained me to explain statistical results in a simple and structured way, not just show numbers and plots.
